# Javascript-Quiz


## Project Contents
- index.html (main webpage file)
- style.css (give the page a custom appearance)
- script.js (main contnet file)


## Description
This project was made in order to refresh my knowledge of Javascript. The approach
was to use dom manipulation and local storaage to make a quiz that somewhat challenges 
both myself and future users on certain aspects of JavaScript.

The project is currently incomplete due to a drastric increase in complexity by the event handlers.
